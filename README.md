# Online Game Server (Java/Spring Boot)

This project is a basic online game server built using Java and Spring Boot. The server supports matchmaking via TCP WebSockets and is in progress for adding gameplay using UDP.

## Features

- **TCP WebSocket Matchmaking**: Allows players to find and join games in real-time.
- **UDP Gameplay Server** (in progress): To handle real-time player interactions (planned for next time I get bored).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the server using Spring Boot.
3. Use a custom UDP client or any UDP testing tool to communicate with the server.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- WebSockets (TCP)
- UDP

## Future Improvements

- Implement UDP-based gameplay communication.
- Improve matchmaking and game state synchronization.
